shs-meta2.txt
August 8, 2017. This supercedes shs-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization shs.txt.


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}   208025 : Devanagari, coded in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}       10 : italic text 
{??}        10 : unreadable text

The <> style of coding is used as follows:
<>     53027  :  beginning of normal line
<P>       69  :  beginning of paragraph (only in preface)
<H>       49  :  Headline. Primarily at 'letter' breaks in lexicon
<Poem>X</Poem> 9 : Delimit a Poem.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>001-a<k1>afRin<k2>afRin
{#afRin#}¦ mfn. ({#-RI-RiRI-Ri#}) Free from debt or obligation; also
<>{#afRin#} E. {#a#} neg. {#fRin#} a debtor.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in shs dictionary.



Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
In general, Page breaks have the  form [PageX], where X usually has the
form PPP-C+ nn,  where
  PPP is 3-digit page number, 001 to 839
  C is column identifier, a or b
  nn is the number of following text lines in column C of page PPP.
In the title page, 
 X = '-titel+ 21'.
X = 001-a+ 43, 840-b and 840-1b contain list of abbreviations

Excluding the two meta-lines for each entry and the Page break lines,
the lines of the shs.txt digitization correspond to lines of the printed text.

Non-devanagari Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been converted to IAST unicode,
 generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. This differs from the coding of the printed version.


Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in shs.txt in this coding,
